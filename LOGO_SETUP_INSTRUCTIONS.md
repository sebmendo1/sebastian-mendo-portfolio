### **File Format Recommendations:**

2. Select "Save Image As..." or "Save Picture As..."
3. Navigate to `public/images/logos/` in your project
4. Save with the exact filename listed above

### **Logo Positioning:**

âœ… **Already Configured:**
- All logos are positioned in the **top-left corner** of each card
- Responsive sizing: 40px on desktop, 32px on tablet, 28px on mobile
- Proper aspect ratio maintained with `object-fit: contain`
- Optimized opacity (0.9) for subtle appearance

### **Backup Options:**

If you need to use different logo files, simply:
1. Replace the existing files with the same names, OR
2. Update the file paths in the component files:

```javascript
// Example: Update in SalesforceCard.js
<img src="/images/logos/your-new-logo-name.png" alt="Salesforce" className="logo-image" />
```

### **Verification:**

After saving the logos, refresh your browser. You should see:
- âœ… Professional logos instead of emojis
- âœ… Logos positioned in top-left corner of each card
- âœ… Proper sizing across all device sizes
- âœ… Clean, minimalist appearance

### **Troubleshooting:**

**If logos don't appear:**
1. Check file paths match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Ensure files are in `public/images/logos/` folder
3. Clear browser cache and refresh
4. Check browser console for any error messages

**If logos appear too large/small:**
- Adjust the `height` value in each card's CSS file:
```css
.logo-image {
  height: 40px; /* Adjust this value */
  width: auto;
  object-fit: contain;
}
```

Once you save the logos, your portfolio will have professional branding for each project! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
